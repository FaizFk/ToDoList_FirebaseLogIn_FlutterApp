# to_do_list_firebase

Made ToDoList App and took it beyond(not really ðŸ˜…). I added the feature to Login/Signup so everyone can have their data stored on web and access it from anywhere. Also the user will stay logged in until he doesn't logout. I can't specify in the app but long press to delete the task.

Let me know any bugs you find, though my code is spaghetti...
